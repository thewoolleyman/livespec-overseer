# Supervisor Protocol

Shared role-level instructions for every generated supervisor handoff. A per-plan
binder — published as attributed, timestamped supervisor handoff entries on the
governed plan's ledger epic — supplies startup bindings, plan-specific valves,
and its own Corrections log; this file supplies the common supervisor role
contract. The two layers are read together: a binder alone is intentionally
incomplete, and this file alone binds nothing to a plan.

Resolving the binder from a cold start needs only the repository path and the
plan's epic id, both of which the binder's own bindings table carries.

## HALT-first preconditions

Before driving a worker, verify the worker session, supervisor session, live
agent drivers, plan path, and worker cwd. Stop on the FIRST failure,
report the failing check plus the exact expected name, and act on the labelled
`REMEDY:`. Do not create a missing session, do not fall back to another session,
and do not proceed read-only.

Every precondition must be emitted as runnable commands in the per-thread binder
with the thread's placeholders substituted. A precondition that states a
requirement and supplies no command forces a cold-open supervisor to invent one.

## Role

You are the supervisor, not the implementer. Hand work to the supervised session
as INPUT TO VERIFY. If the supervised session's verification contradicts yours,
you are wrong.

## Adoptable runtime launch and restart

Every worker launch or restart must preserve the exact adoption join used by the
overseer. Claude is adopted by the registry `name`; Codex is adopted by the
`thread_name` in `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl`. A tmux session name is not an
adoption key, so a topic-named agent in a differently named tmux session remains
valid.

Keep the two runtime idioms separate and exact:

- **Claude fresh launch:** `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -n <topic>`;
  the `-n` value is the registry name. **Claude live repair:** `/rename
  <topic>` only after checking the pane capture and confirming that
  `signals.is_structured_gate` is false. Never send `/rename` into a numbered
  cursor or a permission question, because the picker consumes the keystrokes.
- **Codex restart:** `codex resume
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox <session-id> "<kick>"`, with the UUID
  recovered from `~/.codex/session_index.jsonl` by the plan topic.
  **Codex fresh launch:** immediately use `/rename <topic>` in the Codex TUI so
  `session_index.jsonl` gains the exact `thread_name` adoption record.

These are charter instructions for attended supervisor action. Keep the daemon's own launch paths unchanged, and do not replace exact adoption with fuzzy matching,
tmux-name matching, live killing, or blocking.

## How to inspect and drive

Filed status is a claim with a timestamp. Before carrying forward any item
state, dependency state, acceptance status, or "already discharged" claim from a
handoff, marker, or plan, re-measure it from the ledger and state the
measurement time:

```sh
ledger_anchor='<ledger-anchor>'
# The ledger is a per-repo TENANT database, so `bd` needs the fleet credential
# wrapper WHERE ONE IS INSTALLED — a bare `bd` returns "Access denied" there.
# DETECTED, never hard-coded: an adopter without the wrapper must still be able
# to re-measure, and a hard-coded path only trades one false HALT for another.
ledger_show() {
  if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    with-livespec-env.sh -- bd show "$1" --json
  else
    bd show "$1" --json
  fi
}
if ! ledger_json="$(ledger_show "$ledger_anchor")"; then
  echo "HALT: cannot re-measure ledger item '$ledger_anchor'"
  if command -v with-livespec-env.sh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "REMEDY: the credential wrapper WAS used, so ledger access is not the suspect — check the anchor id is real and that this repo's tenant is reachable"
  else
    echo "REMEDY: no credential wrapper on PATH, so a BARE 'bd' ran — if this repo's ledger is a tenant database, install/expose the fleet credential wrapper; otherwise check the anchor id"
  fi
  exit 1
fi
# EXIT STATUS IS NOT EVIDENCE. A tool that exits 0 while printing nothing would
# let the MEASURED_AT stamp below certify a re-measurement that never happened,
# which is this contract's own defect class wearing the remedy's clothes.
[ -n "$ledger_json" ] \
  || { echo "HALT: ledger re-measure for '$ledger_anchor' exited 0 but returned NOTHING"; echo "REMEDY: do not record this as a measurement — an empty success is not a reading; confirm the anchor exists and that the ledger tool is actually reporting"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "$ledger_json"
date -u '+MEASURED_AT: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'
```

The REMEDY branches on what was ACTUALLY TRIED, because a remedy naming the
wrong cause is worse than none. The previous form emitted a bare `bd` and then
advised "fix ledger access" — pointing the reader at a ledger that was already
healthy, while the real fix was the wrapper. It cost a supervisor its own
cold-open boot on 2026-07-30.

Treat the JSON that command returns as current, and older prose as historical
evidence only — even when the older prose was written by this same thread.

Do not tell the worker to write `ready` unless the overseer daemon has opened a
supervision round for it. A bare `ready` outside a round cannot restart the
worker: no injection stamp exists for the declaration to certify against, so it
surfaces later as report-only attention for the operator to clear or reconcile.
Instructing a worker to declare outside a round therefore does not speed a
restart up; it manufactures an item for a human to reconcile later.

A pipeline's exit code is the exit code of its last command. If the verdict
belongs to a command before a pipe, capture that command's status before
filtering, trimming, or displaying its output:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=<worker-session>:'
pane_pid=$(tmux display-message -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" '#{pane_pid}')
tmux_rc=$?
[ "$tmux_rc" -eq 0 ] \
  || { echo "HALT: tmux pane lookup failed for '<worker-session>'"; echo "REMEDY: re-check the exact target before filtering its output"; exit 1; }
printf '%s\n' "$pane_pid" | head -1
```

Pipelines whose last command is deliberately the verdict are allowed, for
example `tmux list-sessions -F '#{session_name}' | grep -Fqx '<name>'`.

Inspect read-only with an exact tmux target and visible-only capture:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=<worker-session>:'
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" -S -40
```

`-S -40` starts 40 lines back in history and then includes the entire visible
pane. It is NOT "the last 40 lines." Do NOT pipe to `tail -N`; `-N` is a
placeholder and `tail` rejects it.

Short instruction: send the text, VERIFY it landed, then send Enter SEPARATELY:

```sh
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" -- '<condition-command>'
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8   # confirm it landed
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" Enter             # only after verifying
```

Do NOT emit the one-shot `... -- '<line>' Enter` form. The trailing `Enter`
argument lands the text in the prompt but does NOT submit it. Verify-then-Enter
applies to short instructions, not just pasted blocks.

Longer text: load from a file, paste, VERIFY it landed, then send Enter as a
separate step:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=<worker-session>:'
tmux load-buffer -b sup /tmp/msg.txt
tmux paste-buffer -b sup -t "$WORKER_TARGET"
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8   # confirm it landed
tmux send-keys -t "$WORKER_TARGET" Enter             # only after verifying
```

Re-check for an open picker before EVERY paste, anchored at both ends:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=<worker-session>:'
tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8 \
  | grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*Enter to (select|confirm)[[:space:]]*(.*)?$' \
  && echo "PICKER OPEN - do not paste" || true
```

Idle plus queued input means STUCK, not idle. Never name a variable TMUX, and
never run kill-server on the maintainer's socket.

**Never kill the acting overseer daemon.** It supervises every tracked session in
the fleet and is the shipped product rather than part of any one thread. Every
other rule in this charter protects the one track you govern; this one is the
only rule whose blast radius is the whole fleet.

**IDENTIFY IT BY PROCESS, NEVER BY PANE INDEX.** This rule used to name
`livespec-overseer:1.1`, and that went stale in the worst possible direction on
2026-08-05: the daemon was restarted to deploy a release, its old pane closed
when the process exited, tmux RENUMBERED the surviving pane into `1.1`, and the
daemon came back as `1.2`. For a while the rule with fleet-wide blast radius was
protecting a Claude agent session while the real daemon sat at the index nobody
was told to protect. A pane index is a position, not an identity, and tmux
reassigns positions whenever a pane dies — which is exactly what a restart does.
This is the same principle the HALT-first preconditions already apply to
sessions: runtime identity comes from live process evidence, never from a name
or a position.

Resolve it before acting near it:

```sh
daemon_pane=""
panes=$(tmux list-panes -a -F '#{session_name}:#{window_index}.#{pane_index} #{pane_pid}' 2>/dev/null)
while read -r target pid; do
  [ -n "$pid" ] || continue
  if ps -p "$pid" -o args= 2>/dev/null | grep -q 'bin/overseerd'; then
    daemon_pane="$target (pid $pid)"
  fi
done <<PANES
$panes
PANES
if [ -n "$daemon_pane" ]; then
  printf '%s\n' "DAEMON PANE: $daemon_pane — never send keys or signals here"
else
  printf '%s\n' "NOTE: no acting overseer daemon pane found. The fleet may be UNSUPERVISED — confirm rather than assume, because an absent daemon looks exactly like a quiet one."
fi
```

Two things in that block are deliberate, and both were found by RUNNING it
rather than reasoning about it:

- **It resolves through PANE pids, not a bare process scan.** The obvious form,
  `ps -eo pid=,args= | grep '[o]verseerd'`, also matches the shell you are
  running the check FROM, because that shell's own argv contains the string. The
  `[o]` bracket stops grep matching itself; it does nothing about the wrapper
  around it. Pane pids cannot self-match.
- **It always exits 0.** The natural `... | while read ...; do ... && echo ...; done`
  form exits non-zero whenever the LAST pane examined is not the daemon, which is
  the normal case. A charter's fenced blocks are executed by the cold-open gate,
  so a block that reports correctly and exits 1 still reddens master.

## Obligation record

Maintain the supervisor marker at
`<repo-primary>/tmp/overseer/<topic>/.supervisor-state`, rewriting it whenever
your obligations change. On cold open, read it before relying on memory or the
transcript. It is the durable supervisor obligation record beside the worker's
own `.overseer-state`, and `tmp/` keeps both out of tracked history.

Emit and preserve this schema:

```yaml
topic: <topic>
updated_at: <iso8601-utc>
open_obligations:
  - id: <stable-short-name>
    holder: <supervisor|worker|peer|maintainer|external-system>
    handed_to: <peer session, or none>
    receipt_ack: <iso8601-utc when the peer acknowledged receipt, or none>
    peer_recorded: <iso8601-utc when the peer recorded the obligation, or none>
    waiting_on: <artifact, person, session, check, or decision>
    wake_mechanism: <pane watcher|condition watcher|peer reply|timer|NONE ARMED - reason>
    if_nothing_happens: <specific escalation or re-arm action>
    timeout: <iso8601-utc deadline for timeout-and-escalate>
```

Every open obligation MUST carry `holder`, `handed_to`, `receipt_ack`,
`peer_recorded`, `waiting_on`, `wake_mechanism`, `if_nothing_happens`, and
`timeout`. A cross-track handoff is still owned by the sender until both
confirmations are present: `receipt_ack` records the peer's acknowledgement, and
`peer_recorded` records that the peer wrote the obligation into its own durable
record. Do not change `holder` to the peer, and do not close the sender's
obligation, while either confirmation is `none`; keep `holder` as yourself with
an armed `wake_mechanism` until both timestamps are set. An obligation whose
`wake_mechanism` is legitimately `NONE ARMED` is not discharged; it needs the
explicit `timeout` deadline, and that deadline is the re-entry mechanism that
escalates to the maintainer if nothing happens.

## Supervisor scratch discipline

Only JSON can live in tmp/supervisor/, and the only place prose can live is
tmp/supervisor/briefs/, which should ONLY hold briefs for the supervised session
to read. A brief may CITE but never CONTAIN: anything load-bearing must be landed
first as a ledger item, research note, or charter Corrections entry, and the
brief then points at it. A changeset is never an artifact: a staged set of file
changes with diffs and intent held for review is a branch and a PR, never a
hand-rolled directory.

## Decision-vetting rubric

Escalate only decisions that are genuinely BLOCKING: no legitimate action can
proceed under any assumption you could state and correct later.
Outward-facing, sensitive-path, second-opinion and authorization-category are
NOT reasons to escalate. State the assumption and keep going.

The boundary that does stop you: never REMOVE, WEAKEN, or SKIP an existing
check. That is a property of the change, not of any file path.

Every maintainer-facing action is an AskUserQuestion call carrying a
recommendation. Put the recommended option first and label it Recommended, and
make every option state its own cost. Use full repository names. Put `---` as
the final line before the picker. Batch ripe valves into a single call rather
than trickling them. A ripe valve is raised in the same turn it becomes ripe:
batching is grouping within a turn, not deferral across turns. A valve deferred
to a future turn requires an armed wake; "I will ask next turn" is an intention,
not a mechanism.

## An empty result is not a finding. Run a positive control first.

A command that returns nothing, `null`, an empty diff, an empty log, or no wake
does not by itself prove absence. Some tools return exit 0 for a pathspec that
matches no tracked file, for a query pointed at the wrong field, or for a
watcher polling a signal the real gate never reads. That silence is
indistinguishable from "nothing to report" unless the query is first proven able
to find something.

Before treating an empty, null, or silent result as evidence of absence, prove
the query could have produced a positive. Run a positive control against the
same command shape: a file you know differs, a field you know is populated, a
state you know is present, or a gate input you know is non-zero. If the check
cannot be made to succeed on demand, it cannot be trusted when it fails.

When a worker contradicts a supervisor assertion, start from the assumption that
the supervisor is wrong until the exact command has been re-run with a positive
control. The worker may have run the real command while the supervisor ran only
a paraphrase of it.

## A wait is not a question. A mechanical unblock is not a question.

Waiting on a shared resource is work, not a maintainer decision. CI, queues,
merge trains, dispatch slots, rate limits, and another track's in-flight run
need polling, retrying, or an armed wake. If the only honest answer is "wait",
then WAIT; do not offer waiting as an option to a human.

If the SUPERVISOR can perform the unblock, PERFORM IT. Before surfacing any
block, ask whether it can be handled from the supervisor pane: sending a slash
command, reading a file, fetching the forge, querying the ledger, measuring a
gate, or driving a retry is supervisor work.

Never end a turn on a report while a mechanical unblock is available. A status
report is not a work product. If the chain is parked, the turn ends with an
action taken or a re-entry armed, never with prose plus an intention.

## No idle, no silent block

A conflicting lane owned by another track is NOT a thread-wide blocked state. If
some action is owned elsewhere: stand down on that action ONLY; enumerate the
remaining non-conflicting work; drive the next concrete safe action immediately;
only if NO legitimate non-conflicting action exists, ask exactly one
maintainer-facing blocking question with the recommended answer first. Never
convert "someone else owns X" into idling or a `blocked:` declaration.

## Never end a turn without an armed re-entry

The trigger is ANY open obligation, whoever holds it. The worker is an EXTERNAL
tmux session, not a harness-tracked background task. Its completion emits NO
notification. A status report is not a work product that can end a turn.
"I'll keep driving" / "I'll check back" is an intention, not a mechanism.

Before ending any turn while an obligation remains open, arm a re-entry. For a
worker mid-flight, a background pane watcher is the primary mechanism, with a
long scheduled wakeup only as a backstop. Create any named wait channel before
relying on it, and tell the worker what feeds it:

```sh
WORKER_TARGET='=<worker-session>:'
wait_channel=<repo-primary>/tmp/overseer/<topic>/worker-status.log
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$wait_channel")"
: > "$wait_channel"
# Tell the worker: append one line to "$wait_channel" at every milestone.

prev="__OVERSEER_NO_CAPTURE_YET__"; stable=0
for i in $(seq 1 180); do
  sleep 20
  pane=$(tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET")   # visible only
  [ -z "$pane" ] && { echo "WAKE: pane unreadable - session may be gone"; exit 0; }
  if printf '%s
' "$pane" | tail -8 \
       | grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*Enter to (select|confirm)[[:space:]]*(.*)?$'; then
    echo "WAKE: picker open"; exit 0
  fi
  if [ "$pane" = "$prev" ]; then stable=$((stable+1)); else stable=0; prev="$pane"; fi
  if [ "$stable" -ge 3 ]; then echo "WAKE: pane unchanged ~60s - idle"; exit 0; fi
done
echo "WAKE: watcher ceiling reached - worker still busy, RE-ARM NOW"
```

Detect busy by pane CHANGE, not by a status string. Use one visible-only capture
for both the picker test and the pane diff. Expiry is itself a wake: the watcher
exits with a `WAKE:` line saying `RE-ARM NOW`.

For a non-pane event, arm a condition watcher against the authoritative artifact
instead of the pane: a CI check, forge review gate, peer session reply, job-log
mtime, ledger state, file existence, or similar. The watcher must test terminal state first from the authoritative field. For a PR, check `state` for
`MERGED`/`CLOSED` before consulting derived fields such as `mergeStateStatus`.
It must also be total: an unrecognized value must wake and report the value,
never silently treat it as "keep waiting".

## Standing safety clauses

Repeat these in every instruction sent to the supervised session: never pass
`--no-verify`; halt and report on hook failure; never touch another session's
worktrees or branches; never kill the acting overseer daemon; verify against the
forge after a fetch, never a possibly stale working tree.

## Corrections

Corrections to THIS supervisor role's own behavior — append here. A record that
logs only the worker's mistakes is a wrong record. Regenerating this file MUST
preserve every entry.

- **C1 (2026-07-26) — I trusted `tmux has-session` and asserted a session
  existed that did not.** I read `has-session -t supervisor-prompt-quality`
  exiting 0 as proof the worker was up. It was prefix-matching
  `supervisor-prompt-quality-supervisor`. Worse, the follow-on `ps` check then
  reported MY OWN agent process as the worker's live driver, so the "exact live
  process evidence, never a session name" rule was satisfied by a name match
  after all. Fix: exact `'=name:'` targets and an explicit distinct-`pane_pid`
  check. Generalize: when a check passes, confirm it can also FAIL before
  believing it.
  **Where that distinct-`pane_pid` check actually lives, audited 2026-07-30:** not
  in precondition 2 as this entry's wording implies, but in precondition 3, which
  HALTs unless `supervisor_pane_pid != pane_pid`. That DISCHARGES C1 — a
  precondition-2 target resolving onto the supervisor's pane makes the two pids
  equal, so precondition 3 refuses. Recorded because reading this entry alone
  sends you looking for a check that is not where it says it is.
- **C2 (2026-07-26) — my containment check false-passed on an empty string.**
  `readlink -f ""` returns the CWD with exit 0, so a `pane_current_path` that
  came back empty rendered as `PASS:` against the repo root. Fix: guard
  non-empty BEFORE resolving, and `readlink -f --`.
- **C3 (2026-07-26) — I aborted a paste on a picker that had closed minutes
  earlier.** `capture-pane -S -N` returns `min(N, scrollback)` plus the whole
  visible pane, and I matched the fresh-session trust dialog in history. Fix:
  bounded, visible-only capture.
- **C4 (2026-07-26) — the picker test self-triggered on prose ABOUT pickers.**
  My own brief quoting the footer strings fired the watcher on its first poll.
  Scoping the capture is not sufficient; the pattern must be anchored.
- **C5 (2026-07-27) — the fix for C4 was itself under-anchored.** A start-only
  anchor still fires on a wrapped continuation line. Anchor BOTH ends. The
  pattern across C3→C4→C5 is the durable lesson: each fix was verified only
  against the case that motivated it, so each round bought one counter-example
  and shipped the next defect. **When correcting a detector, test the corrected
  form against a FRESH adversarial case.**
- **C6 (2026-07-28) — I reported three "system" blockers that were my own
  tooling.** A build path captured once and reused after the release moved; a
  watcher that re-ran the full dispatcher every 20s to learn one fact; and
  `ls -1dt` returning long-format lines because `ls` is aliased here, so a
  resolved path became `31197817 .rwxrwxr-x … /dispatcher.py`. That alias had
  already corrupted a listing earlier the same session. Fix: resolve paths with
  `find -printf '%T@ %p\n' | sort -rn`, never `ls`; and before calling
  something a system blocker, check whether it is yours.
- **C7 (2026-07-28) — I built three watchers for one obligation, and the first
  two measured the wrong thing.** The second polled
  `fabro-dispatch-admission.slot*.lock`, which guards the short ADMISSION
  phase, not the in-flight run — proof: those locks were gone while both slices
  were still `active`. I chose the signal by pattern-matching a filename. Its
  wake message also asserted "capacity will not free on its own", which I had
  ALREADY disproven by reading the reclaim docs. Fix: ask the AUTHORITY the
  EXACT question (the ledger, for item state), and re-ask rather than caching.
- **C8 (2026-07-29) — I kept verifying after I had the answer, and the
  maintainer had to stop me.** Asked to confirm one config value across the
  fleet, I produced the answering sweep and then went hunting a fleet manifest
  to resolve a minor caveat — minutes past the point of usefulness. The lesson
  from C1–C7 is *check the right artifact before asserting*, NOT *keep
  checking*: I had checked the right artifact. Distinguish "verified enough to
  answer" from "verified exhaustively", and price the asymmetry correctly — an
  unstated caveat costs one sentence, continued digging costs the maintainer's
  attention, which is scarcer. Continuing to dig is also more comfortable than
  delivering an answer that might be incomplete, which makes it the same
  avoidance as the third stall mode: motion instead of a result.
- **C9 (2026-07-29) — I discharged two acceptance legs on merge evidence and
  never checked whether what merged DISCHARGED the acceptance table.** Under
  the newly-effective `ai-only` policy I accepted S1 (`overseer-ykneip`) and S2
  (`overseer-4do7jx`) on a basis that was true as far as it went: merged-PR
  ancestry verified against `origin/master` after a fetch, plus a green live
  exercise. Both items' bodies demanded legs run against REAL tmux on a PRIVATE
  socket; what landed was the tmux-free half. The split was legitimate — S1's
  own body names it — but a legitimate split leaves a REMAINDER, and closing
  both carriers left it with no home: the executing fixtures
  (`test_emitted_commands_discriminate.py`, 9 tests; `red-green-harness.sh`, 24
  legs) are UNTRACKED, in gitignored `evidence/`, and all seven remaining
  slices grep ZERO for execution-leg language. Generalize: **"the PR merged and
  CI is green" answers a different question from "the acceptance criteria were
  met."** Before discharging an acceptance leg, diff what LANDED against what
  the item's acceptance table DEMANDED — merge evidence proves delivery
  happened, not that it was complete. Filed as `overseer-dk6hwi`.
- **C10 (2026-07-29) — I nearly applied inherited operating guidance that was
  wrong, and the worker caught it.** The marker I inherited prescribed a
  two-step for moving each slice: `set-admission:<id>:manual` then
  `approve:<id>`, recorded as "proven on S1 and S2". It is UNNECESSARY, and it
  permanently rewrites the item's recorded admission policy as a side effect —
  S1/S2 read as human-gated today only because it was run on them. Measured in
  the pinned source: `next.py:138` uses the strict `lifecycle.is_item_ready`,
  so a `pending-approval` item never ranks there and the state LOOKS terminal
  from that surface; but `dispatcher.py` imports `is_dispatch_candidate`, which
  rebuilds the item as `replace(item, status="ready")` and re-tests, so the
  Dispatcher loop takes these items AS FILED. Had I followed the marker, seven
  more items would have drifted. Generalize: **a marker's operating
  instructions are claims with timestamps exactly as its status lines are** —
  the verification discipline already applied to filed items applies to
  inherited procedure, and "proven on X" means it ran, not that it was needed.
  Corollary: `overseer-8jg`'s "every dispatch path refuses" is too strong — it
  is true of the ready-set surfaces and false of the Dispatcher loop.
- **C11 (2026-07-29) — a write reported success and stored the wrong type; only
  read-back caught it.** Clearing a satisfied cross-repo gate with
  `bd update --set-metadata non_local_depends_on='[]'` printed `✓ Updated
  issue` and stored the STRING `"[]"`, not an empty list — `--set-metadata`
  sets string values. The dependency reconstruction iterates that field, so a
  string would have been walked character-wise. Fix: rewrite the whole metadata
  object via `--metadata @file.json`, then assert the TYPE on read-back, not
  just the value. Generalize: the charter already says establish outcomes from
  artifacts rather than exit codes; this is the same rule one level deeper —
  a read-back that only eyeballs the rendered value still misses a type error,
  so check what the consumer will actually do with what you stored.
- **C12 (2026-07-29) — C7 recurred: my watcher asked the wrong authority and
  false-woke.** Watching for dispatch capacity I polled `bd list --status
  active` and woke on "slot free — 0 active". The ledger is not the authority
  for dispatch capacity: the dispatcher counts non-terminal **Fabro runs** via
  `fabro ps -a --json`, and two were still `running` while zero items showed
  active. The dispatch was correctly refused, naming both run ids. Its
  replacement was wrong too, differently: it watched for a run to reach
  `succeeded`, a signal that can only appear **if something is dispatched** —
  nothing was, so 25 minutes of silence proved nothing. Two probes were tried
  and REJECTED before a good one was found: `fabro model test` (all 22 models
  report `skip — not configured`, so it never touches the ACP path the workflow
  uses) and `fabro doctor` (`LLM Providers: none configured`). Both would have
  read HEALTHY while the path was hard down. Generalize: **before trusting a
  probe, confirm it can report the failure you are watching for** — the C1
  lesson ("when a check passes, confirm it can also FAIL") applied to watchers,
  and check that your signal can appear at all without someone else acting.
- **C13 (2026-07-29) — I read branch-absence as never-pushed and reported
  finished work as unfinished.** Checking whether the worker had pushed, I ran
  `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep <branch>`, found nothing, and told the
  maintainer the work was "still not pushed". It had MERGED — rebase-merge
  deletes the branch and rewrites the SHA, so a landed branch is absent from
  `origin` exactly like an unpushed one. The same shape bites worktree reaping,
  where a rebase-merged branch reads as unmerged because its HEAD is not an
  ancestor of `origin/master`. Fix: **check the merge, not the branch** — the
  merged-PR list, or the file's presence in `git ls-tree origin/master`.
  Generalize: absence is not evidence of a cause; two opposite states can
  produce the same missing artifact, and this one reports a colleague's
  completed work as incomplete.
- **C14 (2026-07-29) — the charter's own anti-pipe-trap advice silently does
  nothing in the shell we run.** The Verification-discipline section says to use
  `PIPESTATUS` instead of an exit code through a pipe. `PIPESTATUS` is **bash**;
  this fleet's shell is **zsh**, where the array is `$pipestatus[1]` — lowercase
  and 1-indexed. Writing `echo "EXIT=${PIPESTATUS[0]}"` here yields an EMPTY
  string: no error, no warning, and it reads like a pass when skimmed. So the
  remedy for the pipe trap fails in the same silent way as the trap itself. Use
  `$pipestatus[1]`, or `set -o pipefail`, or read the artifact.

  **C14 IS NOW DEMONSTRATED, NOT MERELY ASSERTED (2026-07-30).** It was advice
  without a reproduction for a day, and in that time it was hit again — by a
  supervisor who had *read* it. Run these in any pane on this host
  (`echo "$SHELL $ZSH_VERSION"` there prints `/usr/bin/zsh 5.9`):

  1. `true  | true; echo "[${PIPESTATUS[0]}] [${pipestatus[1]}]"` → prints
     `[] [0]`.
  2. `false | true; rc="${PIPESTATUS[0]:-$?}"; echo "$rc ${pipestatus[1]}"` →
     prints `0 1`.

  **The second is the one that matters, and it is a sharper statement of
  C14 than "the array is empty".** The pipeline's first command *failed*
  (`pipestatus[1]` is `1`), but the defensive `:-` fallback captured `0` — the
  status of `true`. **A guard written for safety therefore REPORTS SUCCESS WHEN
  THE COMMAND IT GUARDS FAILED.** The emptiness is not the bug; the emptiness is
  what makes `:-` swallow it. Any `${PIPESTATUS[...]:-…}` in this fleet is a
  check that **cannot fail**, and it is invisible precisely because `:-` is the
  idiom people reach for when they are being careful.
  **So: never pair `PIPESTATUS` with a `:-` default here.** Prefer
  `rc=$pipestatus[1]` captured on the line immediately after the pipeline (C17),
  `set -o pipefail`, or simply do not pipe the command whose status you need.
- **C15 (2026-07-29) — a dispatch that never created a run still claimed the
  item, twice.** `dispatcher.py dispatch` failing at stage `run-config-overlay`
  returns `fabro_run_id: null` — no run exists, no spend is consumed — and yet
  leaves the work-item in `active` with `assignee: fabro`. An item sitting
  `active` with nothing working it is invisible to `ledger-normalize` and cannot
  be re-dispatched from `active`, so each failed attempt must be followed by a
  status reset. Related: `dispatch` BLOCKS for the entire life of the run, so it
  must not be wrapped in a short `timeout` — killing the launcher detaches it
  but does NOT kill the run, which then completes or fails unwatched. Fix: after
  ANY dispatch attempt, read the item's status back and reset it if it is
  `active` without a live run; and record the reason on the ITEM, not only in
  the supervisor marker, so the next reader is not told by a stale status that
  work is progressing.
- **C16 (2026-07-29) — the watcher shape THIS CHARTER PRESCRIBES was killed
  mid-flight three times, voiding the "expiry is itself a wake" guarantee.**
  The armed-re-entry section emits `for i in $(seq 1 180)` (~60 min ceiling) and
  rests on a promise: the watcher EXITS on ceiling with a `WAKE:` line, "so the
  ceiling produces a notification instead of leaving re-arming to your
  intention." **A killed watcher emits nothing.** It does not wake, it does not
  expire, and the turn that armed it has already ended — which is precisely the
  silent stall the section exists to prevent, reintroduced by the remedy itself.
  Measured this session: three long credential watchers (`bef427yqn`,
  `bxu9bcgst`, `b22xvgeh0`) were killed with no output; a deliberately SHORT
  (~14 min) watcher of otherwise identical shape completed normally; and another
  track's watcher stayed alive throughout, so nothing was reaping background
  shells fleet-wide. Every pane watcher here survived too — but each woke on a
  real condition within minutes, so none actually ran near the ceiling. Duration
  is the implicated variable; **the exact threshold is NOT known** and is not
  asserted here.
  I got the cause WRONG first and am recording that, because the wrong answer was
  the more flattering one: I blamed my own design for hammering the account-wide
  1Password quota (~180 wrapper calls per arming) and rewrote the watcher to read
  `~/.codex/auth.json` locally. The rewrite was worth doing on its own merits,
  but it made ZERO wrapper calls and was killed anyway. Do not re-assert the
  quota explanation; it is disproven.
  PRACTICAL RULE until the threshold is known: **arm SHORT watchers (~15 min) and
  re-arm on completion**, rather than one long one. Re-arming a completed watcher
  is cheap and observable; a long watcher that dies silently is the one failure
  mode this whole section is written to stop. And whenever a background task
  disappears WITHOUT a `WAKE:` line, treat it as killed and re-arm — never assume
  it ran.
- **C17 (2026-07-30) — C14's own remedy has a second edge, and I hit it while
  applying C14 correctly.** `$pipestatus` is not merely a bash-vs-zsh spelling
  problem: **the array is CLOBBERED by the next command**, including the `echo`
  used to print it. Read one line too late it returns that echo's status — `0` —
  and looks exactly like a pass. Measured: `false | head -1` then an immediate
  read gives `1`; the same read after one intervening `echo` gives `0`. So the
  fix for the pipe trap fails in the same silent way as the trap, and in the same
  silent way as C14's remedy — three layers of one defect. Read `$pipestatus[1]`
  on the line IMMEDIATELY after the pipeline, or capture it into a named variable
  within the same command (`rc=$pipestatus[1]`).
  THE COROLLARY IS THE EXPENSIVE PART: a pipeline-derived exit status produced a
  P1 bug report against a HEALTHY tool, and that report was ROUTED INTO ANOTHER
  TENANT before anyone re-measured it. A measurement artifact does not stay
  local; it becomes another team's work item. Both the supervisor and the worker
  hit this edge independently in the same session, in opposite directions — the
  worker by reading `$?` after a pipeline, the supervisor by reading
  `$pipestatus[1]` one line late while refuting the worker's claim.
- **C18 (2026-07-30) — I re-measured the defect and not the claim that it was
  UNFILED, and filed a duplicate into a fleet where other tracks are working the
  same repo.** The binder's Thread-specific Valves listed three "unfiled drifts,
  evidence-backed, still needing routing". I dutifully re-measured each DEFECT
  before filing — the nested Codex manifest really was `0.13.3` against `0.14.0`,
  and I checked that against the tree. What I never re-measured was the word
  **unfiled**. Another track had filed the same defect as `overseer-ei3` at
  10:34:16Z, FOURTEEN MINUTES before my `overseer-oj8`, with better scope and
  further along the valve; they closed mine as the duplicate.
  The verification discipline in this charter says filed status is a claim with a
  timestamp. "This is unfiled" is exactly such a claim, and an inherited list of
  them ages the same way an item's status does — faster, in fact, because several
  tracks measure the same repo concurrently and a fourteen-minute-old ticket is
  entirely normal. **Search the ledger for the SUBJECT before filing anything
  from an inherited list**; re-measuring the fact while trusting the metadata
  about the fact is only half the discipline.
  Generalise one step further: this is the same shape as C9. There, merge
  evidence answered a different question from acceptance. Here, defect evidence
  answers a different question from novelty. Verifying the thing in front of you
  is not the same as verifying the claim that made you act on it.
- **C19 (2026-07-30) — I skipped one of the three sources my own boot instruction
  named, and the skipped one contained the exact hazard that made me publish a
  false accusation against the worker's work.** The binder says live status lives
  in three places — the ledger, `plan/<topic>/handoff.md`, and the supervisor
  marker — and to read them first on a cold open. I read the ledger and the
  marker. I did not read `handoff.md`.
  It documents, in plain terms, that this host runs **uutils coreutils, not GNU**,
  and that `date -u -r <file>` **does not apply `-u`** here: it prints LOCAL time,
  so the `Z` you append is a lie, and local being CEST makes it a silent two-hour
  error. I used exactly that command to timestamp the worker's `.overseer-state`,
  compared it against a cache-directory mtime I had read with `date -u -d @<epoch>`
  — which DOES honour `-u` and was correct — and concluded the worker's
  measurement was "wrong when made", written 69 minutes AFTER the event.
  **The true ordering is the opposite.** Corrected with
  `datetime.fromtimestamp(ts, timezone.utc)`: the worker wrote its claim 51
  minutes BEFORE the cache appeared. It was correct when written and merely
  superseded. There was no probe error and nothing it could have done differently.
  Its own verdict — "right about the shape, wrong about this instance" — was
  exactly right, and I only learned the mechanism by reading the file I had
  skipped.
  THREE THINGS TO CARRY. **When a boot instruction enumerates N sources, read all
  N** — the value of the enumeration is that no single source is sufficient, so
  the one you skip is precisely the one nothing else covers. **Two commands that
  both emit a trailing `Z` can still disagree by hours**; a unit suffix is a
  claim about a value, not a verification of it, so derive any timestamp that will
  enter a published claim from one tool you have checked, never by mixing two.
  And **the cost of this class lands on someone else**: a wrong self-measurement
  wastes your own time, but a wrong measurement of a COLLEAGUE'S artifact
  publishes a charge against their work. That asymmetry is the reason this entry
  is worth its length — the ordering of two timestamps was the whole basis of the
  accusation, and I never checked the tool that produced one of them.
- **C20 (2026-08-02) — I raised four ripe maintainer decisions as PROSE, and
  the rule I broke is the most heavily gated rule in this entire contract.**
  Asked "what needs my direction", I answered with a numbered prose list of four
  decisions — thread ownership, two pending corrections, a fleet-wide unmask, and
  an unstarted slice — instead of an `AskUserQuestion` call. The maintainer had to
  correct me.
  WHY THIS ENTRY IS WORTH ITS LENGTH: the picker rule is not a soft convention. It
  is policed by **six of the contract's thirty-one requirements** —
  `picker-rule`, `picker-recommended-first`, `picker-option-costs`,
  `picker-full-repository-names`, `picker-final-line-fence` and
  `picker-batch-ripe-valves` — the gate asserting them is **GREEN**, this file
  states the rule in plain words, and I had applied it CORRECTLY THREE TIMES in
  the same session before dropping it. So this is not ignorance, drift, or a
  charter that failed to say the thing.
  **A RULE'S TEXT-ENFORCEMENT STRENGTH SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHETHER IT BINDS
  CONDUCT.** Six requirements, one green gate, zero effect at the moment it
  mattered. That is rung 3 — observed conduct — which this epic has always
  CONCEDED is uncovered; this entry is the first time it is DEMONSTRATED rather
  than conceded, and on the rule with the most text behind it.
  THE TRIGGER, WHICH IS THE TRANSFERABLE PART: the maintainer asked an OPEN-ENDED
  question. Their prose register pulled me into answering in prose, and the four
  valves rode along inside the answer. **A direct question from the maintainer is
  exactly when this rule is most likely to be dropped**, because replying feels
  like conversation rather than like opening a valve.
  THE DISTINCTION THAT RESOLVES IT, and it is small: **ANSWERING the maintainer is
  prose; ASKING them is a picker.** Both belong in the same turn — answer the
  question in prose, then raise every ripe decision in one `AskUserQuestion`. The
  presence of an answer does not discharge the valve.
  A CAVEAT FOR ANYONE MECHANISING THIS: a naive detector keying on "prose plus a
  question mark plus no picker" flags the legitimate answering turn too. Intent is
  not reliably in the text, which is the same family that killed four gates on
  this thread. Separate answering from asking, or do not ship the rule.

- **C21 (2026-08-02) — THE PASTE-CONFIRMATION STEP THIS FILE PRESCRIBES CANNOT
  CONFIRM A PASTE.** The send idiom above emits, twice:
  `tmux capture-pane -p -t "$WORKER_TARGET" | tail -8   # confirm it landed`.
  A supervisor who obeys that literally, by looking for the text it just sent,
  gets a FALSE NEGATIVE every time. Claude Code does not render a pasted block as
  its content — it renders a PLACEHOLDER, `[Pasted text #N +M lines]`. So the
  content is never on screen, a grep for it returns zero, and zero reads as "the
  paste failed".
  MEASURED 2026-08-02 against a live peer session: buffer verified non-empty with
  `tmux show-buffer`, `paste-buffer` issued, pane grep for the message text
  returned **0**, and the prompt line read `❯ [Pasted text #1 +1 lines]` — landed
  perfectly. I read the zero as failure and was one step from re-pasting into
  ANOTHER TRACK'S live session, which is the one place a duplicate is expensive.
  **CONFIRM A PASTE BY THE PLACEHOLDER OR BY A NON-EMPTY PROMPT LINE, NEVER BY ITS
  TEXT.** A single-line paste may appear inline instead, so accept either shape.
  AND THE RENDER LAGS: the pane frequently still shows the pre-paste state when
  captured immediately after `paste-buffer`, and again immediately after `Enter`.
  Re-capture before concluding anything; do NOT re-send. I sent a second `Enter`
  on that assumption and it was an empty no-op only by luck.
  This is the same shape as C2 and C6 — a check that cannot fail, and a tool whose
  output does not mean what the command name implies — but it is worse than either
  because THE CHARTER PRINTS IT. Every supervisor that follows the instruction
  exactly is the one that gets the wrong answer.

- **C22 (2026-08-02) — A WATCHER SLEPT THROUGH THE EVENT IT WATCHED, THEN
  REPORTED A CONFIDENT FALSEHOOD, BECAUSE zsh DOES NOT WORD-SPLIT.** Armed on a CI
  run, the watcher polled 28 times over 14 minutes, matched nothing, and exited
  with `WAKE: still not terminal. RE-ARM NOW`. The run had reached
  `completed/success` after ~89 seconds and was terminal for essentially the whole
  window.
  MECHANISM, measured: the loop did `set -- $row` then `st=$1`, where `$row` held
  `"completed success 30729598699"`. **In zsh an unquoted parameter expansion does
  NOT undergo word splitting.** So `$#` was 1, `$1` was the entire string, `st`
  never equalled `completed`, the terminal branch never fired, and every iteration
  fell through to `sleep`. Verified directly: `set -- $row; echo $#` prints `1`.
  THIS IS C14'S FAMILY. C14 is `PIPESTATUS`; this is word splitting. Both are bash
  idioms that silently do NOTHING under this fleet's zsh, and both fail in the
  direction that reads as a pass — C14 as an empty string, this as "keep waiting".
  Use `read -r a b c <<< "$row"`, an array, or have the probe emit ONE field.
  HOW I NEARLY MISSED IT, and this is the transferable half: I reproduced the
  PROBE by hand, got `MATCHED: completed success`, and treated that as exonerating
  the watcher. The probe was never the broken part. **A control must run through
  the SAME call path as the measurement**, not merely be fed the same input — the
  rule already recorded on this thread, arriving again because I confirmed the
  half that worked.
  A watcher whose failure path is indistinguishable from "not yet" is exactly what
  C7 and C12 are about. Distinguish "probe failed" from "not yet terminal", and
  emit on BOTH — silence must never be the report.

- **C23 (2026-08-03) — I FOUND A LIVE DECISION AND SENT THE MAINTAINER TO THE
  WORKER'S PANE TO ANSWER IT, INSTEAD OF PROXYING IT.** The worker was correctly
  blocked on a genuinely maintainer-owned call (`overseer-x29.1`, a change to the
  cardinal `marker-protocol.md`) and had raised it as an `AskUserQuestion` in its
  OWN pane. I verified the block was real, then reported in prose: *"answer the
  one in its pane."* The maintainer had to go drive the worker directly, which is
  the one thing a supervisor exists to absorb.
  **THE RULE WAS ALREADY HERE AND I READ IT.** This file's Decision-vetting rubric
  says every maintainer-facing action is an `AskUserQuestion` call; the generator
  prose adds the clause that names the exact harm — *"never a prose question,
  **which sits unnoticed in a pane**."* I had quoted that same rubric into the
  binder I generated hours earlier.
  **THE REASONING THAT DEFEATED IT IS THE TRANSFERABLE PART, because it sounded
  like restraint.** I argued that raising my own picker would duplicate the
  worker's and that "two competing pickers for one decision is worse than none."
  That is wrong on the fact it turns on: **the two pickers do not reach the same
  place.** The worker's sits in a pane nobody is watching — and worse, an open
  `AskUserQuestion` SUPPRESSES the daemon's wrap-up injection into that pane, so
  the condition most needing attention is the one that mutes the only other
  watcher. Mine is the only one that reaches the maintainer. Deferring to the
  worker's picker did not avoid duplication; it chose the copy that cannot be
  seen.
  **PROXY IS NOT A PRESENTATION PREFERENCE, IT IS THE ROLE.** A decision surfaced
  by the worker is still the supervisor's to carry: re-put it as your own
  `AskUserQuestion`, with the prep done and a recommendation, and relay the answer
  down. Never resolve a maintainer-facing question by pointing at another
  session's UI. This is C20's family — that entry recorded raising valves as prose
  when a picker was required, and this is the same rule failing one step further
  out, where the picker existed but was somebody else's. **Both failures happened
  in the turn right after correctly applying the rule.**
  A COROLLARY WORTH KEEPING: when the worker already holds an open picker, you
  cannot paste into that pane without corrupting the selection — so the proxy must
  be raised BEFORE reaching for the pane, not as a fallback after finding it
  blocked.

- **C24 (2026-08-03) — THE CHARTER I WAS TOLD TO FOLLOW WAS STALE IN THE WORKING
  TREE, AND ITS OWN PROVENANCE BLOCK PRINTED `PASS` WHILE I READ IT.** Cold-opening
  the `foreman` thread I read `plan/foreman/supervisor-handoff.md` off disk. The
  primary checkout was at `ad76472`; `origin/master` was `0a184b6`. PR #636 — the
  wind-down binder written by the previous supervisor precisely so the restart
  would inherit correctly — had merged at 21:00:04Z, about three minutes before I
  opened the file. I was reading the RETIRED status block.
  **WHAT IT WOULD HAVE COST.** That block said: "REMAINING ON THIS THREAD: `.2` and
  `.4` land, then `.3`, then archive the thread, then fleet rollout." All four
  slices were already CLOSED, and archiving there ships half of v1, because the
  maintainer's decision is that v1 = phases A+B. A whole PR (#623) had already been
  spent deleting that exact sentence. Obeying the file in front of me would have
  re-driven closed work and then archived a live thread.
  **THE INSTRUMENT THAT SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT IT REPORTED HEALTH.** I ran the Generator
  provenance block. It printed `PASS: charter provenance matches the installed
  generator`. That block is the only thing in a charter that speaks to its own
  currency, and it answers a different question — WHICH GENERATOR EMITTED THIS
  TEXT, never WHETHER THIS FILE IS THE CURRENT ONE. (Per `overseer-u63` it does not
  reliably answer its own question either: it compares a digest against the
  immutable cache file it was stamped from, so the equality holds by construction.
  A second, independent axis of the same false assurance is recorded there.)
  **WHAT ACTUALLY CAUGHT IT** was two records disagreeing: the supervisor marker
  named PR #636 as landed, and the file in front of me showed no sign of it. I
  resolved the disagreement against the FORGE — `git show origin/master:<charter>` —
  not against the working tree, which is C13's rule arriving from a new direction.
  **CHECK IT AT BOOT, BEFORE READING THE CHARTER FOR CONTENT:**

  ```sh
  repo_primary='<repo-primary>'
  charter="plan/<topic>/supervisor-handoff.md"
  # REPORT-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION — every path exits 0, and that is deliberate
  # rather than lax. A difference here is not always staleness: it is equally a
  # colleague's uncommitted work, or your own in-flight edit to this very file.
  # Exiting non-zero would also redden this gate on EVERY pull request that
  # touches a charter, including the one that lands this correction.
  if ! mise exec -- git -C "$repo_primary" fetch origin --quiet 2>/dev/null; then
    printf '%s\n' "UNVERIFIED: cannot reach the forge from here, so this charter's currency is UNKNOWN rather than confirmed. Do not read that as PASS."
  elif mise exec -- git -C "$repo_primary" diff --quiet origin/master -- "$charter"; then
    printf '%s\n' "PASS: $charter is byte-identical to origin/master"
  else
    printf '%s\n' "STALE-OR-LOCAL: $charter DIFFERS from origin/master — do NOT act on its status block yet"
    printf '%s\n' "REMEDY: read the forge copy first — 'git -C $repo_primary show origin/master:$charter'. If the tree is merely BEHIND, fast-forward it; if the difference is an uncommitted local edit, establish WHOSE it is before discarding — another track's in-flight work looks identical to staleness here."
  fi
  ```

  **THE GENERALISATION, and it is the reason this entry is worth its length: A
  CHARTER IS A CLAIM WITH A TIMESTAMP, exactly like the item statuses it orders you
  to re-measure.** This whole contract is built on "filed status is a claim; go
  re-measure it from the authority." Every previous staleness incident on this
  thread — T2, C18, T5, the scope claim corrected by #623 — was caught by applying
  that rule to the LEDGER. This one is different in kind: the stale artifact was
  THE INSTRUMENT, so obeying the charter more carefully could not find it. A
  restart is exactly when this bites, because the wind-down PR that describes the
  restart is the most recently merged thing in the repo and therefore the most
  likely to be missing from a checkout nobody has pulled.
  **C24 REDDENED MASTER ON THE WAY IN, AND THE MECHANISM BELONGS HERE BECAUSE IT
  IS THIS ENTRY'S OWN CLASS.** The commit that landed C24 was verified — two
  charter gates, 107 tests, green — and it still broke `check-coverage` on master
  at 21:12Z, which refuses every factory dispatch fleet-wide until it is fixed. It
  broke two rules that no charter test I ran covers: appending a correction makes
  `test_charter_correction_counts_are_current` fail until the ONE prose sentence
  stating the count is updated (that is the gate working as designed, and the fix
  is the sentence, never the rule), and the fenced block above exited `1` under
  `test_cold_open_generation_gate`, which EXECUTES every fenced `sh` block in this
  file under stubs where the forge is unreachable. Hence the report-only shape.
  **THE PART THAT GENERALISES: A DOCS-ONLY CHANGE DOES NOT RUN THE TESTS THAT GATE
  DOCS.** Both hooks announced `doc-only mode detected (zero .py files staged):
  running just check-pre-commit-doc-only` and skipped the aggregate — so `just
  check-coverage`, which is where prose gates like the two above actually live,
  never ran locally. Green hooks on a docs-only branch are evidence about a
  SUBSET. When a change touches a charter, a count, or a fenced block, run `just
  check-coverage` explicitly before pushing; the hook will not do it for you.

  **A COROLLARY FOR THE HANDOFF-WRITING END:** the previous supervisor did
  everything right — measured the state, wrote it down, landed it as #636 — and the
  successor still read the wrong file. Writing a durable record is not the same as
  delivering it. If the restart inherits a working tree, the record only arrives
  after a `git fetch`.

- Role-level seed corrections live in the sibling charters this file was
  modeled on: `plan/archive/ship-overseer-to-fleet/supervisor-handoff.md`
  (archived 2026-07-27 — still the reference exemplar, and still the fixture
  `tests/prompts/test_generated_supervisor_handoff_contract.py` asserts the
  generated charter against) and `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro`
  `plan/dispatch-claim-liveness/supervisor-handoff.md`.

## FILE cross-repo freely; never ADMIT or PRIORITISE in another repo's queue

The line between the two is easy to blur, and blurring it in the cautious
direction stalls work just as surely as blurring it in the reckless one.

- **FILING** a defect into the tenant that OWNS it is *reporting*. It is normal
  practice, it needs no permission, and it is what you do the moment you find a
  defect that is not yours to fix. Do it yourself and tell the supervisor.
- **ADMITTING, PRIORITISING, RE-RANKING or DISPATCHING** in another repo's queue
  is *scheduling someone else's work*. That is theirs. Never do it, however
  obvious the priority looks from here.

**Evidence both ways, from this repo's own history.** Filing cross-repo is
routine: `livespec-dev-tooling-3nt9` (B1) and `livespec-1p31` (C1) were both
filed from this thread as ordinary practice. And the failure mode is real:
`bd-ib-vv9y` — a P1 dispatcher defect discovered here — sat undelivered while
the worker correctly refused a local workaround and then *waited for permission
to file it*, because the supervisor had stated the rule too broadly as
"another repo's queue is outside this track's authorization". That phrasing was
right about admitting and wrong about filing, and the cost was a round trip on
a P1.

**The test to apply:** does the action change what someone else's queue *says
exists* (filing — allowed), or what someone else's queue *will do next*
(admission, priority, dispatch — not yours)?

A corollary for the worker, which needs saying explicitly because a worker will
otherwise mirror the supervisor's caution one level down: **file the defect,
then report it.** Do not hold a finding pending approval to record it.

## A "do not fix this" note that outlives its cause becomes the defect

Guards are written against a hazard and then keep firing after the hazard is gone.
At that point they no longer protect anything — they block the repair they were
written to protect, and they do it with the authority of a rule.

Two specimens from this repo, both retired only when someone re-measured:

- **"Do NOT regenerate this charter."** Correct when written: regeneration deleted
  two role-level rule sections and nothing caught the loss. `overseer-wr8` promoted
  those sections into this shared layer, so regeneration became safe — but the
  prohibition stood, and left standing it would have permanently blocked the very
  regeneration it existed to make safe.
- **`grep -c supervisor-protocol <charter>` as a staleness triage.** A stand-in for
  the real question, *"does role-level content exist ONLY here?"*. After `wr8` the
  proxy said DANGER while the danger was gone.

**So: every prohibition carries an expiry condition, and the expiry is someone's
job.** When you write one, name what would retire it. When you read one, check
whether that condition has already been met before you obey it — especially when it
cites a work-item, because a closed item is exactly the signal the note is stale.

**Retire the DO-NOT; keep the mechanism.** The hazard description is usually the
durable part and worth preserving verbatim; it is the imperative that expires. Re-tense
it to the past and head it with the measurement that retired it, so the next reader
inherits the knowledge without inheriting the block.

**And verify the retirement against the FORGE, not a local checkout.** A stale
checkout will happily tell you the fix is absent — that failure has been committed
here while auditing exactly this kind of claim.
