"""Detect a persistently failing release lane from its own run history.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The release lane failed 139 of 157 runs between 2026-07-26 and
2026-08-20 and nobody knew. One block ran 123 consecutive failed cuts across
SIXTEEN DAYS (2026-08-03 to 2026-08-19); both times it was noticed, it was
noticed by luck while tracing something else. Work-item overseer-hgq4wi.15.

THREE PROPERTIES THIS MODULE EXISTS TO GUARANTEE, each earned by a measurement
rather than chosen for tidiness:

- IT REPORTS STATE, NOT EDGES. At an 88.5% failure rate a transition-triggered
  alert fires three times in a month and is silent through the rest, because
  most of the lane's life IS the failure. So the answer is always "currently
  failing, N cuts, since T" rather than "it just broke".

- IT CARRIES THE ABSOLUTE LAST-GREEN TIMESTAMP. On this lane the last green can
  be sixteen days back. "failing since 2026-08-03T03:38:02Z" is actionable;
  "123 failures" invites the reader to assume recency and is not.

- IT KNOWS WHEN ITS OWN INPUT IS TRUNCATED. A failure block flush against the
  oldest run supplied is a LOWER BOUND, not a count: the same real block reads
  as 4 cuts at limit 20, 84 at limit 100 and 123 at limit 300. A caller that
  cannot see a green above the block has not measured its extent, and this
  module says so instead of reporting the short number as fact.

The lane state is a pure function of the run history, so the forge call lives
entirely in the caller and no network reaches the enforcement aggregate.
