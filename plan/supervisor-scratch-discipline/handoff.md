# Plan — supervisor-scratch-discipline

**Owning repo:** `livespec-overseer`. **Ledger anchor:** epic
**`overseer-5jttov`** (this repo's beads tenant). **Status: read it from the
ledger** — `/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro:list-work-items --json` and
`/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro:next`. This file stores no status and
carries no checkbox queue.

Created 2026-07-28 at maintainer direction, after an audit found 1,811 lines of
prose — including a groom draft and a staged set of workflow files — living in a
gitignored directory with zero durable backing.

## Read-first chain

1. This file.
2. `research/what-was-in-tmp-supervisor.md` — the audit, the three specific
   hazards, the disposition already applied, and the CI-blindness constraint
   that shapes any fix.

That is the whole chain.

## The rule — stated by the maintainer, verbatim in effect

> Only JSON can live in `tmp/supervisor/`, and the only place prose can live is
> `tmp/supervisor/briefs/`, which should ONLY hold briefs for the supervised
> session to read.

Two corollaries follow, and both are load-bearing:

- **A brief may CITE but never CONTAIN.** Anything load-bearing must be landed
  first — ledger item, research note, or charter Corrections entry — and the
  brief then points at it. This is what makes the directory safe to lose:
  nothing important can be in it, because anything important had to be durable
  before it could be cited.
- **A changeset is never an artifact.** A staged set of proposed file changes,
  with diffs and a description of intent, held for review before landing, IS a
  branch and a pull request. Hand-rolling one gives every downside of git and
  none of the upside — no review, no CI, no history, and silent drift. If a
  change is worth staging it goes on a branch; if it is not ready for a branch
  it is not ready to be a file, and belongs in the ledger or a research note.

## Goals, each with its acceptance

**Acceptance is mechanical or demonstrated-red. "The rule is written down" is
not acceptance** — this repo has shipped two rules that ran and could not fail
(`check-no-workflow-edits`, in neither the aggregate nor CI;
`LIVESPEC_RUN_MUTATION`, a verified no-op), and the whole point of this thread
is that convention already failed once.

| # | goal | acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The rule ships in the generated supervisor charter**, so every future supervisor inherits it rather than rediscovering it | The prose contract `.claude-plugin/prose/supervise-plan.md` carries the rule and both corollaries, and a fixture over GENERATED output goes RED when the rule is absent — demonstrated red, not asserted |
| 2 | **An enforcement check that can actually fail** — `tmp/supervisor/` contains only `*.json`; `tmp/supervisor/briefs/` contains only briefs; nothing else anywhere beneath it | A planted violation (a stray `.md` at top level, a non-brief under `briefs/`) turns the check RED, demonstrated. The check must state in its own output that it is LOCAL-ONLY and cannot fire in CI, because `tmp/` is gitignored |
| 3 | **Verify the existing briefs are already mirrored** — the audit asserts "mostly mirrored" from knowledge, not from measurement | Each of the 18 briefs' load-bearing content is traced to a landed artifact (ledger id, tracked file, or merged PR) or is landed. Report the count found unmirrored — **a nonzero answer is the expected outcome, not a failure**; one is already known (see research §1) |

## Ordering

Goal 3 is independent and can run first or in parallel — it is measurement over
existing files and blocks nothing. Goals 1 and 2 are independent of each other.
There is no hard edge between any of the three.

Suggested first slice: **goal 2**. It is the smallest, it makes the rule
self-policing on the machine where the risk lives, and it converts every future
violation from a judgement call into a red check.

## Scope boundary — do not silently widen

The maintainer scoped this to `tmp/supervisor/`. The same hazard exists for
anything an agent writes outside SCM and the ledger, and that generalization may
be correct — but it is a **different, larger thread** and must not be absorbed
here without an explicit decision. Name it if you find it; do not take it.

## Next action

**Groom `overseer-5jttov`**, then dispatch ready children through the factory
path: `/livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro:drive --action approve:<id>` followed
by `--action impl:<id>`. Do not hand-code implementation inline in a planning
session.
